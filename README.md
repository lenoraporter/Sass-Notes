# Sass-Notes

CSS Pitfalls
-
- No encapsulation
- No Variables
- Not composable
- Bad modularity primitives
- Globals
- Beating-into-submission-driven-developement

Preprocessor Benefits (LESS, SASS, and Stylus)
-

- Compile to CSS
- Parameterized (variables)
- mixins
- composable
- modular
- plug in to your existing tools

Why should we use a preprocessor?
-
A preprocessor gives us things CSS should've given us a while ago. It helps us define similar concepts to CSS, but it isn't CSS. It is an abstraction of CSS and gives us the missing pieces of CSS.

- Adds stuff that should have been there
- Style is faster to build & easier to maintain
- D.R.Y
- It's easier to keep your styles organized
- Easy to setup
- Toolkits on top of preprocessors
- Variables are really important because sometimes we must repeat (Color, Font, etc.)
